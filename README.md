__Using B to program the CLEARSY Safety Platform Starter Kit For Education__

This tutorial presents the programming model, based on B, of the CLEARSY Safety Platform, through a number of examples. These examples are exploited to demonstrate how the platform could be used for education, bridging the gap between formal methods and embedded systems / automation.


__Organisers__
The tutorial is given by:
- Florain JAMAIN (safety engineer), involved in the education over the CLEARSY Safety Platform.
- Thierry LECOMTE (R&D Director), involved in the development of the CLEARSY Safety Platform for Education.

This tutorial is heavily based on the courses and seminars given in different engineering schools and universities in Brasil, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, and UK.
 
__Attending__  
The tutorial will be run within the framework of the ABZ 2023 international conference (https://abz2023.loria.fr/).
